**Effective date:** <YYYY‑MM‑DD>
**Developer/Publisher:** <LEGAL ENTITY / “you”>
**Contact:** [support@yourstudio.example](mailto:support@yourstudio.example)

> **Plain‑English summary (not a substitute for the terms):** You’re buying a license to play <GAME_TITLE>, not the game itself. Mods and streaming are welcome (see Sections 4–6). Don’t extract or redistribute our assets, don’t cheat, and follow community and platform rules. We may patch the game, and online features may change. Refunds follow Steam’s refund policy.

---

## 1) Acceptance

By installing, copying, or using <GAME_TITLE>, you agree to this EULA. If you do not agree, do not install or use the game.

## 2) License Grant

We grant you a **personal, non‑exclusive, non‑transferable, revocable** license to download, install, and play <GAME_TITLE> on devices linked to your Steam account. This license is for **entertainment, non‑commercial** use only, subject to this EULA and platform terms.

## 3) Ownership

We (and our licensors) own all rights in the game and its content (code, art, audio, text, trademarks). You receive a license to use the game; **no ownership** or rights to extract or reuse game assets.

## 4) Streaming & Creator Content License

We give you permission to **record, stream, and monetize** gameplay (including ad revenue, tips, and sponsorships) as long as your content does not include **raw asset packs** or substantially reproduce the game’s art/audio **outside** normal gameplay footage. Please credit <GAME_TITLE> and link to the store page where reasonably feasible. We can request takedown for content that is unlawful, misleading, contains leaked content, or infringes third‑party rights.

## 5) Modding (User‑Generated Content / UGC)

We support non‑commercial modding. Subject to this EULA and any modding guidelines we publish:

* You may create and distribute **mods** that **require** a legitimate copy of <GAME_TITLE> and do **not** include our original assets (models, textures, audio, code) except where we expressly provide modding assets or an SDK.
* Do **not** decompile, reverse engineer, or extract assets except as permitted by applicable law and our mod tools.
* **Distribution:** Share mods via Steam Workshop or other mod sites that enforce content rules. Your mods must not include malware, illegal content, or third‑party IP you don’t have rights to.
* **License you grant to us:** By uploading or submitting UGC, you grant us a **worldwide, non‑exclusive, royalty‑free** license to **host, reproduce, modify for technical reasons, and distribute** your UGC within the game and on our official channels (e.g., screenshots, trailers, curated mod lists). You **retain ownership** of your UGC.
* **Commercial mods:** Contact us for written permission before selling mods or gating them behind paywalls.
* We may moderate, remove, or disable UGC that we reasonably believe violates this EULA or the law.

## 6) Online Features, Fair Play, and Anti‑Cheat

* **Fair Play:** Don’t use cheats, bots, exploits, or unauthorized third‑party tools that provide unfair advantage or disrupt others.
* **Anti‑Cheat:** We may implement server‑side checks or third‑party anti‑cheat in future updates. If introduced, we will disclose the name of the provider and the data it processes in the Privacy Policy.
* We may suspend or terminate access for cheating, fraud, or EULA violations.

## 7) Updates, Patches, and Availability

We may deploy updates, patches, content, or changes that modify or disable features (including mods) when necessary for stability, balance, security, or legal reasons. Online features are not guaranteed to be available at all times.

## 8) Third‑Party Services and Terms

Use of <GAME_TITLE> on Steam is also governed by the Steam Subscriber Agreement. Additional third‑party services (e.g., multiplayer relays, voice, analytics—if enabled) are subject to their respective terms.

## 9) Data & Privacy

Our collection and use of data is described in the **Privacy Policy** below. By playing, you acknowledge that platform providers (e.g., Steam/Valve) process certain data independently under their own policies.

## 10) Epilepsy/Photosensitivity & Health

Some users may experience seizures or discomfort when exposed to flashing lights or patterns. If you or anyone in your family has an epileptic condition, consult a doctor before playing. Stop immediately if you feel dizziness, nausea, or other discomfort.

## 11) Warranty Disclaimer

The game is provided **“AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE.”** To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement. You use the game at your own risk.

## 12) Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, we will not be liable for indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, or for loss of profits, data, or goodwill. Our aggregate liability shall not exceed the amount you paid for the game in the 12 months preceding the claim.

## 13) Refunds

Refunds for purchases on Steam are handled **exclusively by Steam** under the **Steam Refund Policy** (generally within 14 days of purchase and under 2 hours of playtime; subject to change). See: [https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/](https://store.steampowered.com/steam_refunds/). For purchases outside Steam, contact the relevant storefront.

## 14) Termination

This EULA is effective until terminated. It terminates automatically if you breach it. Upon termination, you must stop using the game and uninstall it. Sections that by their nature should survive (ownership, warranties, liability, governing law, etc.) shall survive termination.

## 15) Governing Law & Venue

<Choose your jurisdiction/law and venue. If you sell globally, consider your local law and mandatory consumer protections.>

## 16) Changes to this EULA

We may update this EULA for legal or operational reasons. Continued use after the effective date constitutes acceptance. We will post the updated date and keep prior versions available upon request.

## 17) Third‑Party Components & Notices

This product may include third‑party software/components licensed under separate terms. See **THIRD‑PARTY‑NOTICES.txt** in the game folder or repository. Unity Asset Store content is used under Unity’s Asset Store EULA and may not be redistributed outside compiled builds.

# <GAME_TITLE> — Privacy Policy (Minimal / No‑Analytics Default)

**Effective date:** <YYYY‑MM‑DD>
**Contact:** [privacy@yourstudio.example](mailto:privacy@yourstudio.example)

## 1) Summary

We designed <GAME_TITLE> to run **without collecting personal data** beyond what is strictly necessary to deliver the game via Steam. By default, we do **not** run third‑party analytics or ad tracking in‑game. If we later enable optional analytics, we will update this policy and provide in‑game controls.

## 2) Data We Process

* **Platform data (Steam):** Your Steam account and platform‑level identifiers are processed by Valve to provide entitlements, cloud saves, achievements, and multiplayer features. We receive limited, non‑sensitive information from the Steam API as needed to run the game (e.g., your display name, owned DLC flags). We do not receive your payment details.
* **Crash/Log data (local):** The game may create local logs or crash dumps for troubleshooting. We do not automatically upload these to our servers. If you email us logs for support, we will use them only to diagnose your issue.

## 3) Optional Analytics (OFF by default)

If we introduce analytics in the future, it will be **first‑party and anonymous where feasible** (e.g., session counts, level completion, performance metrics). We will:

* Disclose the provider and types of data;
* Provide an in‑game **opt‑in** (or at minimum a clear **opt‑out**);
* Avoid collecting precise location, contact lists, or other sensitive data;
* Aggregate or pseudonymize data when possible.

## 4) Anti‑Cheat (Not Present by Default)

If we later add anti‑cheat, we will name the provider, describe what it scans (e.g., running processes, kernel drivers), when it runs (only with the game vs. system‑wide), and provide links to the provider’s privacy policy. We will update this policy before enabling it.

## 5) Children

<Set your policy: e.g., the game is not directed to children under 13/16.> We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child provided us data, contact us to delete it.

## 6) Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data. Contact us at [privacy@yourstudio.example](mailto:privacy@yourstudio.example). We may ask you to verify your request via your Steam account.

## 7) Data Retention

We keep support emails/logs only as long as necessary to resolve your issue, then delete or anonymize them. We do not keep analytics data unless/ until analytics are enabled (see Section 3).

## 8) Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect any data we hold. No method is 100% secure.

## 9) Sharing

We do not sell personal data. We share data only with service providers necessary to operate the game (e.g., Valve/Steam) or as required by law.

## 10) International Transfers

If we store or process data outside your country, we will take steps to ensure adequate protection consistent with applicable laws.

## 11) Changes to this Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy and will revise the effective date above. Material changes will be communicated in‑game or on the store page.

## 12) Contact
